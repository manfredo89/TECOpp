TECO++ is a C++ translation of the Fortran TECO model.

To compile install the armadillo libraries and "make".

The release version uses Intel C++ compilerr icpc and MKL libraries.
Edit the Makefile to use a different compiler / libraries.

TECO++ is work in progress.
The input is currently embedded in the code.

To generate Doxy documentation install Doxygen and graphviz and "doxy teco_config".

Feel free to fork the repo and commit new changes, I'll be happy to merge.
